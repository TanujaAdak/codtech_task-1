# To-Do List

This is a To-Do List web app created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, with data saved in `localStorage` for persistence. The design is clean and responsive, offering a simple yet effective user experience.


## Overview of the Project

### Project: To-Do List Web Application

**Purpose:**
The To-Do List web application is a simple task management tool that allows users to keep track of their tasks. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks as well as mark tasks as completed.

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML:** Structures the web page, providing elements like headings, input fields, buttons, and containers for the list items.
- **CSS:** Styles the web application, ensuring it is visually appealing with responsive layouts, colors, fonts, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity to the web application, enabling functionalities like adding tasks, editing tasks, marking tasks as complete, and deleting tasks. It also uses `localStorage` to persist tasks across sessions.

**Key Features:**
1. **Task Addition:**
   - Users can enter a task in the input box and click the "Add" button to add it to the list.
   - If the input box is empty, an alert prompts the user to enter something.

2. **Task Management:**
   - **Editing:** Each task can be edited by clicking the pencil icon next to the task. This allows the task content to be changed.
   - **Deletion:** Each task can be deleted by clicking the "Ã—" icon.
   - **Marking Complete:** Tasks can be marked as complete by clicking on them. Completed tasks are displayed with a line through the text and a checkmark.

3. **Data Persistence:**
   - The tasks are stored in `localStorage`, so they remain available even after the browser is closed and reopened. 

4. **Responsive Design:**
   - The application is styled to be responsive, with a gradient background, a centered to-do list container, and hover effects for better user experience.

**File Breakdown:**
- **`index.html`:** 
  - The main structure of the application, including the header, input field, and container for tasks.
- **`style.css`:** 
  - The styling for the page, including layout, fonts, colors, and hover effects.
- **`script.js`:**
  - The logic behind the task addition, editing, deletion, and storage, ensuring the application is interactive and data is persistent.

**User Experience:**
The application provides an intuitive interface where users can quickly add, modify, and remove tasks. The use of icons for editing and deleting tasks simplifies task management, and the clear feedback from task completion (strikethrough text) enhances usability.

This project serves as an excellent introduction to web development, covering the basics of front-end technologies and providing practical experience with JavaScript event handling and local storage.
